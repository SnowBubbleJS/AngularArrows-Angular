              You’re doing great! Now that we understand controllers a little more, let’s move onto the <b>factory</b>. A <b>factory</b> is a <b>service</b> in AngularJS that’s used to allow one or multiple <b>controllers</b> to access a data set. These <b>controllers</b> can then read or modify the data in the <b>factory</b>. The concept to create a <b>factory</b> is straightforward: create an object, add properties to the object, then return the object. After passing the <b>factory</b> to the <b>controller</b>, it will then have access to the object returned from the <b>factory</b>. For the purposes of this tutorial, in the <b>factory.js</b>, we have a function that returns an object with data that we want to use in our app. However, this data might also be used in another <b>controller</b>. In order to keep the data in one spot while allowing both <b>controllers</b> to read/manipulate the data, we’ll create a <b>factory</b> that returns this data set. Let’s move onto to the next prompt to see what we need to do.

            <h1 class="md-display">Tab Two</h1>
            <p>
              Take a look at the <b>factory.js</b>, we have the function myFactory with an array called ‘FriendsList’ with multiple objects. We want to use this ‘FriendsList’ and display just the names. Similar to how the <b>controller</b> was created, we first need to link our application to the <b>factory</b> using the 'getter' syntax. Then, we will add a <code>.factory('myFactory', myFactory)</code> right below the <cdoe>.module</code>, just like how you did it in <b>controller.js</b>.  The first argument in the <b>factory</b> method is the name we want for our <b>factory</b>, and the second argument is a function that returns an object with data.
