        Take a look at the <b>factory.js</b>, we have the function myFactory with an array called ‘FriendsList’ with multiple objects. We want to use this ‘FriendsList’ and display just the names. Similar to how the <b>controller</b> was created, we first need to link our application to the <b>factory</b> using the 'getter' syntax. Then, we will add a <code>.factory(‘myFactory’, myFactory)</code> right below the <cdoe>.module</code>, just like how you did it in <b>controller.js</b>.  The first argument in the <b>factory</b> method is the name we want for our <b>factory</b>, and the second argument is a function that returns an object with data. For more information on how a factory should be implement, please refer to: <a href="https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#factories">https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#factories</a>.
