        In order to bind the view to our controller, we will use $scope. $scope is the glue between the Controller and the View that helps with all of our data binding needs. First we need to tell Angular that we want to use $scope. In order to do this, we need to put it as the first parameter in our myController function like so <code>function MyController($scope){}</code>, now that we glued the controller to the view, let's make the controller do things. Inside the controller write <code>$scope.name = 'Bob';</code> <code>$scope.age = 30;</code> <code>$scope.occupation = 'hacker';</code>. Now that we're done with that, let's display this information so you can see it.
