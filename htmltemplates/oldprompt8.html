        First, we need to know the role of the controller. A controller as its basic form manages your applications data. We will be creating a controller in the controller.js. Similar to the structure of how you created the module in the app.js, we will need to build the controller in a similar manner. First we need to create the relationship of the controller to the 'myApp'. In the HTML file, add in <code>&lt;div ng-controller='myController'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>. Next, move to the controller.js, in here you will be doing the same thing you did in the app.js to encapsulate the controller in your app. Start by using the getter syntax to chain onto the main module <code>angular.module('app')</code>. Notice the main difference here being that there is no second argument since we're essentially referring to the main module created in <b>app.js</b>. Now that you've created the relationship, let's tell the Angular App that you want to build a controller. You will be doing this by creating a method after the module <code>.controller()</code>, the method takes in two parameters. The first parameter is the name of the controller and the second parameter will be a callback function. The callback function will be responsible for managing data. Follow this format: <code>.controller('myController', myController); function myController(){})</code>.
