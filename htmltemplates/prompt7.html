            <p>
              You must be wondering what .module is.  A module is a container for different parts of your app. In order to add functionality to our application, we need to build a container for our application. We just wrote <code>angular.module('myApp', [ ]); </code> This is telling angular to create a new container encased in where we defined our ng-app. We will explain in depth why the [ ] is there, but briefly, it's where we do dependency injections so our angular app can do cool things. Note the 2nd parameter of [ ] is only put in when we are initially creating the module or container. Because we created this container, it only needs to be referenced when we want to add functionality to our application. What you just did was create a 'setter' (the defining of your angular module with a second argument) following the style guide. Now we can use the 'getter' syntax (discussed later) for every other time we need to reference it!

            <p>
              Before we build the controller, you need to understand that it is common practice to keep all Angular componentry modularized by defining only 1 component per file and even more so to have these separate JavaScript files wrapped within an Immediately Invoked Function expression (IIFE). These IIFEs are created as wrappers for our AngularJS components so that variable names do not clutter the global workspace. IIFEs are characterized by wrapping your function in parentheses followed by a pair of parentheses, for example - ( function(){//codeblock} )(); For more information about the single responsibility of files, please visit https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide#single-responsibility.

            <h1 class="md-display">Creating the controller</h1>
            <p>
              First, we need to know the role of the controller. A controller as its basic form manages your applications data. We will be creating a controller in the controller.js. Similar to the structure of how you created the module in the app.js, we will need to build the controller in a similar manner. First we need to create the relationship of the controller to the 'myApp'. In the HTML file, add in <code>&lt;div ng-controller='MyController'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> inside the body tag. Next, move to the controller.js, in here you will be doing the same thing you did in the app.js to encapsulate the controller in your app. Start by using the getter syntax to chain onto the main module <code>angular.module('myApp')</code>. Notice the main difference here being that there is no second argument since we're essentially referring to the main module created in <b>app.js</b>. Now that you've created the relationship, let's tell the Angular App that you want to build a controller. You will be doing this by creating a method after the module <code>.controller()</code>, the method takes in two parameters. The first parameter is the name of the controller and the second parameter will be a callback function. The callback function will be responsible for managing data. Follow this format: <br><code>angular.module('myApp')<br>{{pad}}.controller('MyController', MyController); <br>function MyController(){<br>}</code>
