        You’re doing great! Now that we understand controllers a little more, let’s move onto the <b>factory</b>.  A <b>factory</b> is a <b>service</b> in AngularJS that’s used to allow one or multiple <b>controllers</b> to access to a data set.  These <b>controllers</b> can then read or modify the data in the <b>factory</b>.  The concept to create a <b>factory</b> is straightforward: create an object, add properties to object, then return the object.  After passing the <b>factory</b> to the <b>controller</b>, it will then have access to the object returned from the <b>factory</b>. For the purposes of this tutorial, in the <b>factory.js</b>, we have a function that returns an object with data that we want to use in our app.  However, this data might also be used in another <b>controller</b>.  In order to keep the data in one spot and will also allow both <b>controllers</b> to  read/manipulate the data, we’ll create a <b>factory</b> that returns this data set.
